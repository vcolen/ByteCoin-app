## Bytecoin's main purpose is to return Bitcoin's current value in different currencies!
It uses the Coin.io API to return the values.

## This is was made with the purpose of fixating the concepts learned in the [Clima App lesson](https://github.com/vcolen/Clima-app), which were:
* How to create a dark-mode enabled app.
* How to use vector images as image assets.
* Learn to use the UITextField to get user input. 
* Learn about the delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions. 
* Swift guard keyword. 
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Learn to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.



## This is a project from the iOS development bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu :)
